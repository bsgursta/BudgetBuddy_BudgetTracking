# BudgetBuddy_BudgetTracker

This project is a full-stack web application that stores and displays user financial information. The main goal is to allow users full control over their financial income and 
their expenses so they can set monthly spending limits and meet their financial goals.

## Development:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, MERN Stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node).

This application is centered around MongoDB where we store each user's account information like expenses, income, goals, etc... React.js was used for adding unconventional parts of the application like our graphic representation of our user's data with another library, and applying the different financial goals visually in between pages. Express and React

## Learned:
  This was my first time creating a framework-based application, especially with team dynamics in a more ambitious project. The process was very formal because we wanted to simulate a conventional project development, albeit with much laxer deadlines.
